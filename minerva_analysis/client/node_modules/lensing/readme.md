## Lensing

#### Note
This plugin introduces a lens to the OpenSeadragon viewer with several characteristic features, including hi-res magnification, physical measurements, exportable snapshots, customized overlays, and localized filtering.
The overlays and filters in particular can be extended to support application-specific tasks.

    // Instantiate viewer
    const viewer = osd(viewer_config);
   
    // Compile dataLoad, i.e. custom filters (empty by default)
    const dataLoad = []
   
    // Instantiate Lensing
    viewer.lensing = l.construct(osd, viewer, viewer_config, dataLoad);
    ```
